<h4>1.1 What is alaterm?</h4>

<p>Alaterm is a customized installation of <a href="https://archlinuxarm.org/">Arch Linux ARM</a>,
which is a version of <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>
compiled for your <a href="https://www.watelectronics.com/arm-processor-architecture-working/">ARM</a> CPU architecture.
Note that alaterm is not a Linux distribution.
It does not provide software. It installs software provided by others, then configures the software
for your <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a> device.</p>

<p>Unlike the independent <a href="https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Arch">TermuxArch</a> project,
alaterm is specifically configured for the benefit of desktop software users, rather than programmers.
The screen is touch-sensitive, and will work on many small devices such as phones.
However, the benefits of alaterm are best with a large tablet, external keyboard, and mouse.</p> 

<p>To use alaterm, you need <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux">Termux</a>.
This app is built with Android developer tools.
Alaterm is not an Android app. It sits as a sub-system within Termux. If you do not need a
graphical desktop, you can run alaterm command-line programs in Termux alone.</p>

<p>When you also have the
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.realvnc.viewer.android">VNC Viewer</a> app,
you can see alaterm on the LXDE graphical desktop, at 127.0.0.1:5901.
Then you can use an image editor such as GIMP, or a document processor such as LibreOffice,
in much the same way as on a laptop computer. The most important difference is that your
device has less processing and storage resources than on a laptop, so this will limit
what you can do.</p>


<a id="h1.2" href="#h">(return to top)</a>
<h4>1.2 How does alaterm affect Termux and Android?</h4>

<p>Alaterm sits entirely within Termux. If you uninstall Termux, you lose alaterm.</p>

<p>After alaterm is installed, you may continue to use Termux without launching alaterm.
The only difference is that alaterm adds a short reminder message to the Termux greeting.
If you subsequently remove alaterm, then Termux continues as before.</p>

<p>Since Termux is no more than a set of files added to Termux, you can manipulate
all alaterm files from Termux (without launching alaterm). You can manipulate many
non-alaterm Termux files from within alaterm, but this is not very useful.</p>

<p>Alaterm does not affect your Android desktop. It is not a separate app.</p>

<p>Alaterm is not a dual-boot. It does not "root" your device, or jailbreak it.
If you have rooted your device on your own initiative, then the consequences of using
alaterm are unknown.</p>


<a id="h1.3" href="#h">(return to top)</a>
<h4>1.3 What can alaterm do?</h4>

<p>The installed software provides the essential elements of a graphical desktop.
When viewed in VNC Viewer, you will see wallpaper, taskbar, Menu, and file manager.
If using a mouse, right-click will display context menus.</p>

<p>Some basic utility programs are pre-installed: calculator, font viewer, PDF viewer,
text editor, programming editor, image viewer, web browser, preferences manager.</p>

<p>From the command line. you can install additional software, including many programs
with advanced features. They will almost always look and operate the same way
as they do on a laptop computer.</p>

<p>You can multi-task. Android is active at all times, and manages WiFi and Bluetooth.
So, while alaterm is running, you can summon an Android Email app and check your mail,
or listen to music from and Android app, or use an Android web browser. Then, you can
return to what you were doing in alaterm.</p>

<p>Be warned that due to limited resources, your device cannot have too many apps
running at the same time. If overloaded, Android may close Termux. So if you
multi-task, be sure to save your work in alaterm before doing something else.</p>


<a id="h1.4" href="#h">(return to top)</a>
<h4>1.4 What cannot be done by alaterm?</h4>

<p>Alaterm can only interact with Android, via the intermediary of Termux. So if Termux
is prohibited from doing something by Android security, then alaterm cannot do it,
regardless of the software you installed.</p>

<p>Termux has only a limited capability to manage services and daemons. This may change
in the future. At this time, software requiring a service or daemon is unlikely to work.
You cannot use a cups printer, but most useful applications can export either PDF
or imnages. You cannot mount external devices, although alaterm may be able to see
some devices (such as a removable storage card) if Android mounts them first.</p>

<p>You cannot use audio programs in alaterm. Actually, there can be a limited audio
capability. But it is hard to configure and is not as versatile as native Android apps,
so there is not point to including it. The same applies to video. If your purpose
is multimedia, then just do it with Android apps, not alaterm.</p>

<p>The graphical Trash (Rubbish) Bin does not work. There is a Trash folder, but its
contents can only be managed via command line. Why? Animated Linux Trash uses system
resources that are blocked by Android security.</p>


<a id="h1.5" href="#h">(return to top)</a>
<h4>1.5 Passwords and Security</h4>

<p>Your username is <b>user</b> and its password is <b>password</b>. It has super-user
privileges within alaterm. Only on rare occasions will you need to use <b>sudo</b>
to obtain a higher level of privilege. Only on the rarest occasions (probably never)
will you need to use <b>su</b> to become the root user (internal to alaterm);
its password is <b>root</b>.</p>

<p>When you connect to VNC Viewer, your password is <b>password</b>.</p>

<p>There is no point to using more secure passwords. This is because anyone who has
access to Termux can create, remove, view, or edit any file in the alaterm sub-system,
without launching alaterm. No passwords are required. For that matter, anyone who
has access to your device, perhpas except for guest account, can simply remove
the Termux app. That will remove all of alaterm as well.</p>


<a id="h1.6" href="#h">(return to top)</a>
<h4>1.6 Technical Details</h4>

<p>You do not need to know this technical information. But if you are curious:</p>

<p>Android is a Linux-like system. Your device storage has several partitions.
Some of them can only be accessed by Android itself. Others can be accessed,
but not modified, by installed apps. Others can be accessed and modified by
various apps, if you grant them the privilege.</p>

<p>One partition is /data. In general, it contains user-installed apps.
Each app lives in its own private area, inacessible to other apps.
Normally, Termux lives in /data/data/com.termux. Its home directory,
which appears when you first launch Termux, is /data/data/com.termux/files/home.
Most of its program software is in /data/data/com.termux/files/usr.
There are other locations. Some are hidden from your view,
even while you are within Termux.</p>

<p>By default, alaterm creates /data/data/com.termux/alaterm as its top level.
This location has the advantage that is is not accidentally removed, if you ever
clean out your Termux home directory.</p>

<p>Within that alaterm top directory are /bin, /etc, /usr, and other locations
expected of an ordinary Linux system. Termux uses <b>proot</b> software
to fool alaterm into thinking that it is installed at the system top level.
This works well, as long as alaterm does not need to make system calls that
are managed by the real system, which is Android.</p>

<p>Alaterm is not entirely jailed. Some other parts of Android are mounted
into alaterm. This allows alaterm to access your shared files, if you have
granted that privilege to Termux. It also allows alaterm to activate a few commands
that are in Termux but not part of the alaterm software installation.</p>

<p>When you launch alaterm, its script automatically launches a VNC server,
which in turn launches the LXDE desktop. The desktop is there, but you can only
see it using the separate VNC Viewer app. If you do not view the desktop,
then you can still use the terminal to perform command-line operations.</p>


<a id="h1.7" href="#h">(return to top)</a>
<h4>1.7 Bug Reports, etc.</h4>

<p>The alaterm project page is at:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cargocultprog/alaterm">
https://github.com/cargocultprog/alaterm</a></p>

<p>But before you post issues or enhancement requests, you need to know that
alaterm is not a Linux software distribution. Alaterm merely provides scripts
that install and configure software provided by another source.</p>

<p>So, if a program does not work, there is nothing alaterm can do about that.
If you need an unavailable program, there is nothing alaterm can do about that.</p>

<p>If you would like to install a different flavor of Linux, such as Ubuntu,
then there is nothing alaterm can reasonably do about that. Although it is
technically possible, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.
The primary disadvantage is that those other distributions are not compiled
for your CPU architecture. The choice of software is limited, and may be very old.
Also, many of them offer an elaborate choice of multimedia programs that
would not work on your device, unless compiled specifically for Android.</p>

<p>If you have an Android device, but it does not have an ARM CPU, then
the alaterm developer has no way to verify whether the scripts work or not.
The same applies if the device has an ARM CPU but does not run Android.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if alaterm installs on your device, but fails to launch
or exhibits unexpected behavior with the basic set of programs, then maybe
something can be done about it.</p>

<p>If alaterm works for you, or if your device has other software that
blocks alaterm installation, then you are invited to mention it.
Please be specific about your device and its Android system.
Note that alaterm is not expected to run on Android older than 8.</p>

<p>The developer will ignore anything concerned with rooting, or with
setting up a file server. Those are not the purpose of alaterm.</p>
