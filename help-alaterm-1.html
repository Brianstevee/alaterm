<h4>1.1 What is alaterm?</h4>

<ul>

<li>Alaterm is a customized installation of <a href="https://archlinuxarm.org/">Arch Linux ARM</a>,
which is a version of <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> compiled for the
<a href="https://www.watelectronics.com/arm-processor-architecture-working/">ARM</a> CPU architecture.</li>

<li>Alaterm is not a Linux distribution. It does not provide software.
It installs software provided by others, then configures the software
for your <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a> device.</li>

<li>Unlike the independent <a href="https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Arch">TermuxArch</a> project,
alaterm is specifically configured for the benefit of desktop software users, rather than programmers.</li>

<li>Alaterm allows you to run the graphical LXDE Desktop, visible with the
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.realvnc.viewer.android">VNC Viewer</a> app
at connection 127.0.0.1:5901.</li>

</ul>


<a id="h1.2" href="#h">(return to top)</a>
<h4>1.2 How does alaterm affect Termux and Android?</h4>

<ul>

<li>Alaterm is <i>not</i> an Android app. To use alaterm, you need
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux">Termux</a>, which <i>is</i> an Android app.</li>

<li>Alaterm sits entirely within Termux. If you uninstall Termux, you lose alaterm.
However, if you choose the default installation for alaterm, then clearing Termux $PREFIX/usr
does not delete alaterm.</li>

<li>After alaterm is installed, you may continue to use Termux.
If you subsequently remove alaterm, then Termux continues as before.</li>

<li>In case of problems, alaterm files can be edited by Termux.</li>

<li>Alaterm does not affect your Android desktop.</li>

<li>You can multi-task. Android is active at all times, and manages WiFi and Bluetooth.
While alaterm is running, you can summon an Android Email app and check your mail,
or listen to music from an Android app, or use an Android web browser.</li>

<li>Alaterm is not a dual-boot. It does not "root" your device, or jailbreak it.
If you have rooted your device on your own initiative, then the consequences of using
alaterm are unknown.</li>

</ul>


<a id="h1.3" href="#h">(return to top)</a>
<h4>1.3 What can alaterm do?</h4>

<ul>

<li>The installed software provides the essential elements of a graphical desktop.
When viewed in VNC Viewer, you will see wallpaper, taskbar, Menu, and file manager.
If using a mouse, right-click will display context menus.</li>

<li>The screen is touch-sensitive, and will work on many small devices such as phones.
However, the benefits of alaterm are best with a large tablet, external keyboard, and mouse.</li>

<li>Some basic utility programs are pre-installed: calculator, font viewer, PDF viewer,
text editor, programming editor, image viewer, web browser, preferences manager.</li>

<li>From the command line. you can install additional software, including many programs
with advanced features. They will almost always look and operate the same way
as they do on a laptop computer.</li>

<li>Be warned that due to limited resources, your device cannot have too many apps
running at the same time. If overloaded, Android may close Termux. So if you
multi-task, be sure to save your work in alaterm before doing something else.</li>

</ul>


<a id="h1.4" href="#h">(return to top)</a>
<h4>1.4 What cannot be done by alaterm?</h4>

<ul>

<li>Alaterm can only interact with Android, via the intermediary of Termux. So if Termux
is prohibited from doing something by Android security, then alaterm cannot do it.</li>

<li>Software requiring a service or daemon is unlikely to work.
You cannot use a cups printer, but most useful applications can export either PDF
or images. You cannot mount external devices, although alaterm may be able to see
some devices (such as a removable storage card) if Android mounts them first.</li>

<li>You cannot use audio programs in alaterm. If your purpose
is multimedia, then just do it with Android apps, not alaterm.</li>

<li>The graphical Trash (Rubbish) Bin does not work. There is a Trash folder, but its
contents can only be managed via command line.</li>

</ul>


<a id="h1.5" href="#h">(return to top)</a>
<h4>1.5 Passwords and Security</h4>

<ul>

<li>Every part of alaterm can be manipulated directly from Termux. There is no point
to having secure passwords in alaterm, because they can be changed without permission.</li>

<li>In alaterm, your username us <b>user</b> and its password is <b>password</b>.
Login is automatic, so you will not be asked for username or password.</li>

<li>When you connect to VNC viewer, the network password is <b>password</b>.</li>

<li>Only on rare occasions will you need to use <b>sudo</b>
to obtain a higher level of privilege. No paswod is required.</li>

<li> Only on the rarest occasions (probably never)
will you need to use <b>su</b> to become the root user.
Its password is <b>root</b>. Note that this is only internal to alaterm. It does not root Android.</li>

</ul>

<h4>1.6 Technical Details</h4>

<p>You do not need to know this technical information. But if you are curious:</p>

<ul>

<li>Android is a Linux-like system, with several partitions. One partition is <b>/data</b>.
This partition contains user-installed apps. They cannot "see" each other
unless you grant permission, and place the shared files in a common area.</li>

<li>Termux normally lives in <b>/data/data/com.termux</b>. Its home directory, which appears
when you open Termux, is <b>/data/data/com.termux/files/home</b>.
Its main software directory, $PREFIX, is <b>/data/data/com.termux/files/usr</b>.</li>

<li>The default install directory for alaterm is <b>/data/data/com.termux/alaterm</b>.
The advantage to this location is that it is unaffected if you clean out your Termux home directory,
or clean out your Termux $PREFIX. However, if you uninstall the Termux app, you also lose alaterm.</li>

<li>Alaterm lives in a "proot" environment. Its software is tricked into thinking that it sits
at the top level of the file hierarchy, just as if it were installed as an ordinary Linux system.</li>

<li>Some programs, such as daemons and services, cannot work in "proot" because they require
true access to the top level. But Android itself is at the top level.</li>

<li>Alaterm does not know about Android. Termuyx handles communication between alaterm and Android.</li>

<li>The "proot" does not completely jail alaterm. If you have granted Termux permission
to access shared files, then alaterm can also access those files.</li>

<li>When you launch alaterm, its script automatically launches a VNC server,
which in turn launches the LXDE desktop. The desktop is there, but you can only
see it using the separate VNC Viewer app. If you do not view the desktop,
then you can still use the terminal to perform command-line operations.</li>

</ul>

<h4>1.7 Bug Reports, etc.</h4>

<ul>

<li>The alaterm repository is at: <a href="https://github.com/cargocultprog/alaterm">
https://github.com/cargocultprog/alaterm</a></li>

<li>Before you post issues or enhancement requests, you need to know that
alaterm is not a Linux software distribution. Alaterm merely provides scripts
that install and configure software provided by another source.</li>

<li>If a program does not work, there is nothing alaterm can do about that.
If you need an unavailable program, there is nothing alaterm can do about that.</li>

<li>If you would like to install a different flavor of Linux, such as Ubuntu,
then there is nothing alaterm can do about that.</li>

<li>If you have an Android device, but it does not have an ARM CPU, then
the alaterm developer has no way to verify whether the scripts work or not.
The same applies if the device has an ARM CPU but does not run Android.</li>

<li>On the other hand, if alaterm installs on your device, but fails to launch
or exhibits unexpected behavior with the basic set of programs, then maybe
something can be done about it.</li>

<li>If alaterm works for you, or if your device has other software that
blocks alaterm installation, then you are invited to mention it.
Please be specific about your device and its Android system.
Note that alaterm is not expected to run on Android older than 8.</li>

<li>The developer will ignore anything concerned with rooting, or with
setting up a file server. Those are not the purpose of alaterm.</li>

</ul>
