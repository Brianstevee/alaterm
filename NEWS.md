### NEWS for alaterm at GitHub.


#### March 4, 2020:
Minor enhancement to detect Termux-alaterm coordination.
Issue fixed in launch command. If you installed alaterm, but it did not launch, have no fear!
Re-run `bash 00-alaterm.bash install` to fix this.
It does not re-download anything but small scripts from here. Only takes a few seconds.
The fix simply re-writes the launch command so that it works for you,
instead of just working for me.

#### March 3, 2020:
Initial public release.

#### March 2, 2020:
Beta testers invited. Should work. Maybe some typos to fix.

#### March 1, 2020:
Final stages of alpha testing. Alaterm certainly works on its developer's device,
and has been working for several months. Currently, help files are being written,
and the scripts are being checked for compatibility when downloaded.

#### February 22, 2020:
GitHub project initialized.
