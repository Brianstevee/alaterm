<h4>2.1. Touchscreen vs. Mouse</h4>

<p>The LXDE Desktop works with touchscreens. Usage is tricky. First, you move the cursor
by sliding your finger. Then, when the cursor is over its destination, you tap.
The trick is that your finger does not have to be over the cursor.</p>

<p>Since most of the useful applications involve images, it is best to use Alaterm
on a relatively large-screen device, with external keyboard and mouse.
My own device is a 10.1 inch tablet. Right-click is supported, with context menus.</p> 


<a id="h2.2" href="#h">(return to top)</a>
<h4>2.2 Screen Dimensions and Orientation</h4>

<p>The Desktop is initially configured for 1280x800 pixel screens.
This assumes that you use your device in landscape mode, like a laptop.
Many modern devices have high-resolution screens. My own is 1920x1200.
However, use of full resolution will cause everything to appear very tiny,
because the software assumes that you are viewing on a large-screen office computer.</p>

<p>If you need a different screen resolution, particularly if your device
has an aspect ratio other than 1.6:1, there are two wayts to change it.</p>

<p>From the LXDE Menu, Preferences, Change Default Resolution.
This offers you a choice of several values.
You can try a value, and if it works for you, save it.
The saved value will then be used each time you login.</p>

<p>If none of the choices is what you need, then you can make a custom choice.
This requires using the terminal, rather than the Menu. Command:</p>
<p>default-resolution WxH</code></p>
<p>where W and H are three or four digit numbers, representing the desired width and height.
The effect is not immediate. To see it, you have to logout then re-launch alaterm.
If you made a bad choice, you can re-try the command, or use the Menu.
Remember that the initial default resolution is 1280x800.</p>
 
<p>The LXDE Desktop does not understand device rotation.
If you set the resolution in landcape orientation,
then it will not fit properly if you rotate your device to portrait orientation, like a phone.
So if you normally intend to use alaterm in portrait orientation,
you should choose a default resolution with its height greater than its width.</p>

<h4>2.3 LXDE Applications Menu</h4>

<p>At the left corner of the taskbar is the applications menu.
Use it to launch programs, and to change some preferences.
The initial setup is pre-configured with:<br/>
<a href="https://wiki.lxde.org/en/GPicView">GPicView image viewer</a><br/>
<a href="https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.6/users-font-viewer.html">Gnome Font Viewer</a><br/>
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince">Evince document viewer for PDF</a><br/>
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Calculator">Gnome Calculator</a><br/>
<a href="https://wiki.lxde.org/en/Leafpad">Leafpad plain text editor</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany text editor for programmers</a><br/>
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Ghex">GHex hex editor</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.netsurf-browser.org/">NetSurf web browser</a><br/>
<a href="https://wiki.lxde.org/en/PCManFM">PCManFM file manager</a><br/>
Preferences, for changing the look and feel of the desktop.<br/>
HELP, which invokes this help file.
</p>

<p>Installation of additional software is performed from the command terminal, as described below.</p>

<p>The Menu can be edited using PCManFM File Manager. However, this is not recommended,
since it requires some expertise.</p>

<p>LXDE installs a few utility programs that only work in office desktop computers.
They cannot be uninstalled, since LXDE expects them to be there.
For your convenience, Menu items leading to these useless programs
have automatically been deleted.</p>

<h4>2.4 PCManFM File Manager</h4>

<p>Next to the LXDE Menu is the File Manager, named <b>PCManFM</b>.
Several useful locations are pre-configured as shortcuts:<br/>
<b>Home</b> is your alaterm home folder.<br/>
<b>Desktop</b> is your alaterm Desktop, a sub-folder of Home.</br/>
<b>Android Shared</b> leads to the Android directory that contains Documents, Downloads,
Pictures, and other on-device locations that can be accessed from alaterm.<br/>
<b>Removable Media</b> leads to an Android directory containing a removable SD card or USB pendrive.<br/>
<b>Termux Home</b> is the home folder for Termux.
This is the initial location when Termux launches.<br/>
<b>Trash</b> leads to Trash at ~/.local/share/Trash.</p>

<p>Note that only Android can mount media.
So if you have a removable media device, be sure that it is mounted and recognized by Android,
before you launch alaterm. Also note that Android gives obscure folder names to
removable media, and also includes folders leading to inacessible locations.
Finding your removable device is a matter of trial and error.</p>


<a id="h2.5" href="#h">(return to top)</a>
<h4>2.5 Trash? Rubbish!</h4>

<p>The creator of PCManFM uses the UK term <b>rubbish</b> instead of the US term <b>trash</b>.</p>

<p>There is no animated Trash Bin. This is because the necessary software would violate
Android system policies, by attempting to access prohibited directories.
Remember that the LXDE Desktop is not specifically written for Android.</p>

<p>The Trash shorcut leads to alaterm Trash. It does not include Android Trash, if it exists.
Even though you can send items to Trash easily,
restoring items and emptying the Trash can only be done by command terminal.
The README-TRASH file describes the commands, It is visible when you enter Trash.</p>
