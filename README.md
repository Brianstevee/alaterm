LXDE Desktop for Arch Linux ARM on Termux Android

This repository was initialized on February 22, 2020. Within the next few days, I will upload code.

Summary: I have a 10.1in Samsung Galaxy Tab A 2019 WiFi tablet, no phone, not rooted. Using the Termux and VNC Viewer apps, I have been able to install Arch Linux ARM with an excellent LXDE desktop. Then, I can run GIMP, LibreOffice, and a variety of other programs that work with touchscreen or mouse and keyboard.

Installation is very complex. For that purpose, I have written a lengthy BASH script that does it all, complete with configuration. When done, it "just works" with a selection of basic utility programs, and is ready for immediate installation of bigger programs. Of course, this kind of device has limitations.

The script is written for the benefit of those who have little or no knowledge of programming. It is not a fork of the well-known TermuxArch project.
