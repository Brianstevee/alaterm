<h1>HELP for Alaterm - Arch Linux ARM in Termux</h1>
<p>Help version 1. February 27, 2020</p>

<p>This help file is intended for those who already installed Alaterm,
and are reading it from within the installation.
But if you are reading the raw text at GitHub, this information is incomplete.</p>

<h2>1. Capabilities and Limitations</h2>

<p>The LXDE Desktop works with touchscreens. Usage is tricky. First, you move the cursor
by sliding your finger. Then, when the cursor is over its destination, you tap.
The trick is that your finger does not have to be over the cursor.</p>

<p>Since most of the useful applications involve images, it is best to use Alaterm
on a relatively large-screen device, with external keyboard and mouse.
My own device is a 10.1 inch tablet. Right-click is supported!</p> 

<p>Alaterm cannot perform any system manipulation unless that privilege is granted to Termux.
For example, at the time I write this, Termux does not have the privilege to start
most services and daemons, even if the software is installed. Therefore, you will be unable
to start a CUPS printer in Alaterm, or a MIDI instrument controller.
That may or may not change in the future, but it is beyond the control of Alaterm.</p>

<p>When Alaterm is launched, you can manipulate some programs directly from the command line.
In that situation, you do not need to launch VNC Viewer, as there is nothing to see.</p>

<p>With VNC Viewer, you can see the LXDE graphical desktop at port 127.0.0.1:5901.
But where is the button for exit or logout? There is none!
You leave Alaterm from the terminal, using <b>logout</b> to return to Termux.</p>

<p>Since Android is always active, you can flip back and forth between Alaterm and ordinary Android apps.
So, you can check your E-mail in Android, while Alaterm sits idle or does something else.
Likewise, you can do something in Alaterm, while an Android app plays music to Bluetooth earbuds.
But remember that your device does not have the resources of a desktop computer.
You have less RAM, no hard drive, and many background processes.
That will limit how much you can do.</p>

<p>As an ordinary user, you are granted superuser privileges within Alaterm.
You can create, delete, and edit most Alaterm system files.
In rare circumstances, you may use <b>sudo</b> for more privileges. No password needed.
In the rarest of circumstances, you may fool Alaterm into thinking that you
ar the root, by using <b>su</b> with password <b>root</b>.
But this is only a deception. You do not gain root privileges in Android.</p>

<p>Without launching Alaterm, Termux can create, delete, or edit files
within the Alaterm installation. So there is no point to having secure passwords.
If you uninstall Termux, then Alaterm is also deleted.</p>


<a id="desktop"></a>
<h2>2. LXDE Desktop, taskbar, and Menu</h2>

<p>At the left corner of the taskbar is the application menu. Use it to launch programs.
The initial setup is pre-configured with:<br/>
<a href="https://wiki.lxde.org/en/GPicView">GPicView image viewer</a><br/>
<a href="https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.6/users-font-viewer.html">Gnome Font Viewer</a><br/>
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince">Evince document viewer for PDF</a><br/>
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Calculator">Gnome Calculator</a><br/>
<a href="https://wiki.lxde.org/en/Leafpad">Leafpad plain text editor</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany text editor for programmers</a><br/>
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Ghex">GHex hex editor</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.netsurf-browser.org/">NetSurf web browser</a><br/>
<a href="https://wiki.lxde.org/en/PCManFM">PCManFM file manager</a><br/>
Plus LXDE utilities for changing the look and feel of the desktop.
</p>

<p>The Menu is pre-configured so that it hides features that are known to fail in Alaterm.
Most of them are system-level services, particularly daemons.</p>

<p>Next to the LXDE Menu is the File Manager, named <b>PCManFM</b>.
Several useful locations are pre-configured as shortcuts.
The home folder for Alaterm is different than the Termux home.
Likewise, Alaterm and Termux have their /usr software directories in different locations.
There are shortcuts to places where Android allows file sharing.</p>

<p>Because Alaterm sits within Termux, which sits within Android,
Alaterm can only do what Termux and Android allow it to do.
Thus, PCManFM can only see what Termux and Android allow it to see.</p>

<p>Android does not allow Alaterm to start most system services.
This is why audio-visual programs, and CUPS printing, are unlikely to work in Alaterm.
If Termux ever gains those privileges, than perhaps Alatarm can take advantage.</p>

<p>Bluetooth and Internet are managed by Android at all times.
If an Alaterm program requires Bluetooth or Internet connection, it will probably work.</p>


<a id="pacman"></a>
<h2>3. Installing and removing software packages</h2>

<p>Arch uses <b>pacman</b>
to install, remove, and query software packages. Its syntax can be obscure.</p>

<p>The most commonly-used pacman commands are case-sensitive:<br/>
<code>pacman -Syu</code> updates all installed software.<br/>
<code>pacman -S packagename</code> installs packagename, or re-installs it if requested.<br/>
<code>pacman -R packagename</code> removes packagename, unless other installed packages depend on it.<br/>
<code>pacman -Rsc packagename</code> removes packagename, its cache, and any dependencies
that were installed at the same time. Use this when you try a package but it does not work as expected.
<p>

<p>Search the Internet for useful how-to info,
such as <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman/Rosetta">here</a></p>

<h2>4. Suggested Software</h2>

<p>For a high-end image editor, use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>:<br/>
<code>pacman -S gimp</code>
</p>

<p>You will get a very up-to-date version of GIMP, with full capabilities. Others will envy you.
However, your device does not have enough computing power to handle multiple large images or many layers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> vector graphics editor can also be installed.
It is a good drawing program,
but a bit hard to understand if you have never used it before.</br/>
<code>pacman -S inkscape</code>
</p>

<p>The <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a>, panorama photo stitcher, can be installed.
However, photo stitching is inherently
demanding of memory, CPU, and read-write temporary file access.
For those reasons, you may find that Hugin is too much for your device.<br/>
<code>pacman -S hugin</code>
</p>

<p>Using the command-line, ImageMagick can perform a great variety of image editing tasks.
ImageMagick, and the similar GraphicsMagick, are widely used when image handling
must be automated by script:
<code>pacman -S imagemagick</code>
</p>

<p>Many modern handheld devices save screenshots and photos in <b>heic/heif</b> format,
also known as <b>h265</b>. Alaterm image applications have the ability to read and write this format,
in principle. In pracice, there is a bug in the software, at the time I write this.
The easiest solution is to let an Android app convert heic/heif to something such as jpg or png,
which can be edited in Alaterm. Another possibility is an online image conversion service.
But if you really need Alaterm software to read and write heif/heic images,
you can compile the necessary software. This takes about 250MB space and 40-60 minutes.
Fortunately, there is a built-in script that does all the thinking for you:<br/>
<code>compile-h265</code>
</p>

<p>You can create sophisticated new fonts, or edit existing fonts, using
the most excellent <a href="https://fontforge.org/">FontForge</a>:<br/>
<code>pacman -S fontforge</code>
</p>

<p>If you wish to install additional fonts, there are several ways to do it. One possibility is that
you can simply install a prepared font package. Or, fonts can be manually installed.
The various possibilities are described on
<a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fonts">this page</a>, but keep in mind that
the selection of prepared packages may be smaller in Arch Linux ARM than in the full Arch Linux.</p>

<p>The TeX typesetter, also known as LaTeX and TeXLive, works well.
It can process via command line, or with GUI programs. To install TeX:<br/>
<code>pacman -S texlive-most</code>
</p>

<p>That will ask you which parts you require. TeXLive is inherently a very large installation,
perhaps up to a Gigabyte. Do not install parts that you do not expect to need.
Although LuaTeX is not mentioned by name, it is part of some other packages there.</p>

<p>Then, you may install a GUI, one or more of:<br />
<code>pacman -S texworks texmaker texstudio</code>
</p>

<p>Paths in Arch are different than paths used by some other distributions.
You may need to configure the GUI programs so that they can find the TeX installation.</p>

<p>There is no <code>tlmgr</code> program for managing TeX.
There is a user-created alternative to <code>tlmgr</code>,
but I have found that occasional updates via pacman are adequate.</p>

<p>You can install the <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> suite:<br/>
<code>pacman -S libreoffice-still</code>
</p>

<p>Do not install libreoffice-fresh. Do not install Java or its runtime.</p>

<p>Before you install the very large LibreOffice suite: Are you sure you need it?
Android has many native apps that can create documents, show slide presentations,
calculate spreadsheets, and even maintain a small database.
Many of them are linked to "cloud" storage via Microsoft or Google, or other providers.
In some cases, your little device sends information to the greate computer in the sky,
which does the heavy work for you, saves the information, and returns processed results to you.
The only reason to use LibreOffice locally is if you are not often connected to cloud storage,
or you have existing documents that must use the LibreOffice file formats.</p>

<p>The Menu will show LibreOffice, and LibreOffice Writer. The other LibreOffice programs are there,
but not shown on the Menu. Launching the main LibreOffice provides a choice.</p>

<p>As with all other Arch programs, LibreOffice is designed for desktop computers with large resources.
Do not even dream of creating a massive relational database on your device, even though the software is there.</p>

<p>You might or might not be able to print to a Bluetooth printer.
You can definitely export files to PDF, move the PDF to where Android can see it, then print from there.</p>

<p>If you intend to play or manipulate multimedia files, then you are in for a world of hurt.</p>

<p>At the time I write this, in late February 2020, Alaterm has only partial support for multimedia of any kind.
This is because all multimedia must pass through Anrdoid, via Termux.
Numerous Android apps have much better multimedia support.
So, there is no reason to spend great effort doing multimedia in Alaterm.</p>

<p>At some future time, maybe Termux will have greater multimedia support,
which can be brought into Alaterm. But do not expect it, and do not ask for it.</p>
